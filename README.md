# psvm-ps
PureScript version management in PureScript, expanding upon [psvm-js](https://github.com/ThomasCrevoisier/psvm-js).

Installs files under `$HOME/.psvm`, and as such, this tool currently only supports Linux given that I don't have access to Windows/MacOS environments. Pull requests to add compatibility for these two operating systems is welcome.
